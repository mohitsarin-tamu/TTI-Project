# Calculating Embankment Depth

This folder consists of the code that is used to find Embankment Depth. 
Here, we have implemented the Peak Detection Algorithm to find the peaks of the rock and then we find the corresponding valleys which is in turn used to find the embankment depth. In addition to this, if we have the ground truth of the peaks, we can also calculate the error in predicting the points.
